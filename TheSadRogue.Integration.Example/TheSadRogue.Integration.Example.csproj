        Warnings disabled project-wide:
          - CA1043: We explicitly permit non-integral/string values to be used as indexers (Point for IMapView)
          - CA1303: Exception strings are non-localized to avoid generating an exception within an exception
          - CA1814: Multi-dimensional array usage in GoRogue is for maps and thus will not waste space
          - CA1710: Suffix of IEnumerable implementations containing collection does not make sense for GoRogue
                    structures; example: Region => PointCollection??  What would Area be?  This convention only makes
                    sense for standard library, generic data structures/additions
          - CA1305: Format providers are not used in string exception messages (again to avoid potentiall generating an
                    exception inside an exception).
          - CA1051: Microsoft guidance on preferring readonly fields to get-only properties to avoid defensive copies
                    when it comes to structs directly contradicts this warning.  Instance fields are necessary for maximum
                    performance in many instances with value types.  Further, field exposure is required to allow passing
                    a parameter via "ref".
          - CA1307: In string comparisons in GoRogue, ordinal behavior is desired, as they are only compared for
                    equality, not sort-order.
          - CA2211: GoRogue specifically allows static mutable fields for configuration options like
                    GlobalRandom.DefaultRNG and Dice parsers.  These fields explicitly document that changing them is not
                    thread-safe behavior, and that they are meant as configuration to be performed during application
                    initialization.  This addresses the main concerns with static mutable fields (thread safety), without
                    costing non-trivial code complexity and performance.
          - CA1062: Nullability validation is performed by C#8 nullable reference types in GoRogue.
